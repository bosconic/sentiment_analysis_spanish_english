# sentiment_analysis_spanish_english
This exploratory data analysis tries to compare the sentiment analysis scores of human and machine translations of poems.

The corpra folder contains the original Neruda poems in Spanish (Poem 1 subfolder), the Human Translation (Poem 2 subfolder) and the computer translated poems (Poem 3 subfolder).

The outputs folder presents the findings and write up of the report, after exploring the nuances of translation and my personal reflection on the matter. The goal of the report was to consider how the source of translation is definately complicated especially if the one translator may not experience or capture the emotion of a particular word and relys on statistical probabilities.
