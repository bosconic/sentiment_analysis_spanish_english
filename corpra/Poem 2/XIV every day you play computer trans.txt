
XIV you play every day ...

You play every day with the light of the universe.
Subtle visitor, you arrive in the flower and in the water.
You are more than this white head
Like a cluster in my hands every day.

No one looks like I love you.
Let me tend between yellow garlands.
Who writes your name with smoke letters between the southern stars?
Ah let me remind you how you were then, when you still did not exist.

Suddenly the wind however and hits my closed window.
The sky is a curd network of gloomy fish.
Here they come to give all the winds, all.
The rain deviates.

The birds run away.
The wind. The wind.
I can only fight the strength of men.
The storm ramoline
And release all the boats that last night tied to heaven.

You are here. Ah you don't run away.
You will answer me until the last cry.
Ovillate by my side as if you were afraid.
However, a strange shadow was ran for your eyes.

Now, now too, little, you bring me hostelvas,
And you have even scented breasts.
While the sad gallop wind killing butterflies
I love you, and my joy bites your plum mouth.

When you have hurt to get used to me.
To my soul alone savage, in my name that everyone scares.
We have viso to burn the light binding so many times kissing our eyes
and on our heads, curtain twilights in rotating fans.

My words rained about you caressing you
I has long loved your body of sunny pearl.
I even believe you owner of Universe.

I will bring you from the mountains happy flowers, Copihues,
Dark hazelnuts, and wild kiss baskets.
I want to do with you
What spring does with cherry trees.
