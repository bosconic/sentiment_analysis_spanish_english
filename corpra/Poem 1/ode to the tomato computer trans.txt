
Ode to tomato

The street
It was filled with tomatoes,
noon,
summer,
Light,
It starts
in two
halves
of tomato,
runs
through the streets
The juice.
In December
unleashes,
Tomato,
invades
kitchens,
Enter the lunch,
sit,
restful,
In the sideboards,
Between the vessels,
The butter,
The blue salt shakers.
Has
own light,
Benign Majesty.
We must, unfortunately,
KILL IT:
It sinks
The knife
In his living pulp,
It is a red
Viscera,
A sun
cool,
deep,
inexhaustible,
Fill salads
of Chile,
He marries happily
With the clear onion,
And to celebrate it
It is left
fall
oil,
son
essential of the olive tree,
About his memispheres ajerace,
Add
The pepper
its fragrance,
salt its magnetism:
They are the weddings
of the day,
The parsley
Raise
flags,
The potatoes
boil vigorously,
The roast
hits
With its aroma
At the door,
It's time!
come on!
and shade
The table, at the waist
summer,
Tomato,
Astro of Earth,
star
Repeated
And fruitful,
It shows us
its circumvolutions,
its channels,
The distinguished fullness
And abundance,
boneless
Without shell,
No scales or thorns,
He gives us
The gift
fiery
and all of its freshness.
