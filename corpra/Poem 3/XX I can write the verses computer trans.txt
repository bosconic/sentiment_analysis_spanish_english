
XX I can write the verses ...

I can write the saddest verses tonight.

Write, for example: ‘The night is starry, 
And throw, blue, the stars, in the distance ’.

The night wind turns in the sky and sings.

I can write the saddest verses tonight.
I wanted her, and sometimes she loved me too.

On the nights like this I had her in my arms.
I kissed her so many times under the infinite sky.

She loved me, sometimes I loved her too.
How not to have loved his big fixed eyes.

I can write the saddest verses tonight.
Think that I don't have it. Feel that I have lost it.

Hear the immense, more immense night without her.
And the verse falls to the soul like the grass of the dew.

What matters that my love could not keep it.
The night is starry and she is not with me.

That's all. In the distance someone sings. In the distance.
My soul is not happy to have lost it.

As to bring my gaze closer.
My heart looks for her, and she is not with me.

The same night that makes whiten the same trees.
We, those of that time, are no longer the same.

I don't want it anymore, it's true, but how much I wanted her.
My voice sought the wind to touch your ear.

Of another It will be another. As before my kisses.
His voice, his clear body. His infinite eyes.

I don't want her anymore, it's true, but maybe I love her.
Love is so short, and oblivion is so long.

Because on nights like this I had her in my arms,
My soul is not happy to have lost it.

Although this is the last pain she causes me,
and these are the last verses that I write to you.
